** If we need to hover a button then use the same class attribute and colon hover to perform the hover operation over the
    html element tag. eg:- .subscribe-button:hover{}
** Opacity --->> It is a property in hover which is used to perform the light visibility of element when hover on it,
    it ranges from 0 to 1 itself.
** If we need to change the style of element after a click then use active styling for it similar to hover property.
    eg:- .subscribe-button:active{}
** In order to make a smooth transition use the transition property where it takes two values,
    first one is the another property
    second one is the time.
** Shadows ----> It is widely used to perform the shadow of the element. It has four properties.
    transition:p1 p2 p3 p4, 
        p1 is the horizontal length
        p2 is the vertical length
        p3 is the blur ratio
        p4 is the color to be chosen here rgba(0,0,0,0.15) a is the opacity of the element to be applied.
    To apply these shadows use box-shadow property.
** CSS Box Model-->> it describes how  much space an element takes up and how far it is away from other elements.
** Using padding it is easy to perform the size of the element rather than the height and width property.
** Vertical align property is used to make the elements be on the proper height with the other elements.
** In order to set the text on the page then use,
    eg:- text-align:center/right/left/top/bottom;
** In order to adjust the line height between lines then,
    eg:- line-height:24px;
** In order to get the special characters on the page like tick, small middle dot then use,
    html entity <character_name>; in css.
** There has been paragraph tag and class attribute allocated for css even though where ever the code is present in the 
    up or bottom, it doesnt matter what kind of specific details you are giving is taken for consideration and is called
    as CSS Specificity.
    eg:- .<class-attribute>{}, p{} here class attribute is more specific so it is implemented and then the other one is 
        implemented as a priority and then the process takes place.
** If there exists a scenario where, some part of the specific text need to be modified or styled then 
    use text element.
** Text element ----->> It is used to style the specific text from the entire text present in it.
        -- it contains pre defined styling such as <strong></strong> which becomes bold
        -- it contains pre defined styling such as <u></u> which does underline.
        -- it does contain <span></span> which can be used with class attribute and can be styled accordingly.
** In order to perform the underline in css then use the text-decoration property.
** Line height is used to put the difference between lines.
** When an image has to be resized, then just resize the width it just automatically resize the height even.
** In order to reframe the image, it can be done through 
    object-postion:- center/left/right;
** display:inline-block/block which is used to give proper spacing for the html elements.
** Inline CSS - Writing related css code in the  html tag itself.
** CSS Grid -----> A css grid is like a layout which contains in the pattern of rows and columns.
** They are used to make the grid look in an appropriate manner without width and height adjustments.
** grid template columns -->> In this property how many number of columns required and even the width of it.
    eg:- grid-template-columns:100px 100px 200px; 
** Incase in the grid template columns if there has been 3 and below if there are 4 then a new row is created after the 
    3 columns are done.
** Incase there has been a grid if the width is given and "fr" is given then it states free space where in 
    whatever the space is present it is occupied by the fr usage.
    eg:- grid-template-columns:100px 1fr;
